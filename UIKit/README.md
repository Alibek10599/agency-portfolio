This example represents a React Native component of a button written on TypeScript and a few variants of types for this button. This code  was a part of UIKit for the design system of the project I worked on.

Button folder contains the logic of the button itself.
UIBoxButton, UILinkButton and UIMsgButton files contain variations in accordance with the requirements of the design system (with settings for typography, colors, sizes, shapes and icons position).
Example file represents buttons usage.
